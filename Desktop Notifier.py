# ðŸ’¡ How to run this program in the background (Windows):
# 1. Save this file as "Desktop Notifier.py"
# 2. Move or save this script inside the Python installation folder 
#    (e.g., C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311)
#    OR be sure to reference the full path to pythonw.exe when running it.
# 3. Open the scriptâ€™s folder in Terminal or PowerShell
# 4. Optional: Run the terminal as Administrator
# 5. Run the script using the following command:
#    > pythonw "Desktop Notifier.py"
#    OR if you're not in the Python folder, use the full path:
#    > "C:\Path\To\pythonw.exe" "C:\Path\To\Desktop Notifier.py"
# âœ… This will run the script silently in the background with no terminal window.
